## Introduction

Here we validate performance of the pulseR package on the simulated data.
We will consider a pulse-experiment with no spike-ins added.
The data include the total and the pull-out fractions for several
time points in three replicates.

In the pulse-experiment, the unlabelled RNA is being degraded, starting
from the steady-state amount at time $t=0$hr. The labelled fraction is being
synthesised with the rate $s$, although it degrades with the same rate $d$ 
as well.
A system of ordinary differential equations, which describes this processes, is
$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{d\text{[labelled RNA]}}{dt} &= s - d \text{[labelled RNA]}\\
\frac{d\text{[unlabelled RNA]}}{dt} &= -d \text{[unlabelled RNA]}\\
\text{[total]} &= \text{[labelled]} + \text{[unlabelled]}
\end{aligned}
$$
For a constant rates of degradation $d$ and synthesis $s$, the amounts of RNA 
at the time $t$ are
$$ 
\begin{aligned}
 \text{[total RNA]} &= \frac{s}{d} \equiv \mu \\
\text{[labelled RNA]} &= \mu (1 - e^{-dt})  \\
 \text{[unlabelled RNA]} &= \mu e^{-dt}, 
\end{aligned}
$$

where $\mu$ is the expression level of a gene in a steady state.

## Definitions

### Formulas

We can simulate count data using internal pulseR function
`pulseR:::generateTestDataFrom`. For this, one needs to define the formulas
for the mean read number of all three fractions:

```{r}
library(pulseR)

set.seed(259)

nGenes <- 530
nReplicates <- 2
nTime <- 4


formulas <- MeanFormulas(
  total        = mu,
  labelled     = mu * (1 - exp(-d*time)),
  unlabelled   = mu * exp(-d*time)
)
```

### Fractions

In reality, there is not pure labelled or unlabelled fractions in samples.
That is why it can be important to model fraction cross-contamination.
Here we assume that the labelled fraction consist of certain amount of
the unlabelled one.
Hence, we distinguish the labelled RNA and the "labelled" pull-out fraction.

```{r}
formulaIndexes <- list(
  total_samp = 'total',
  label_samp = c('labelled', 'unlabelled'),
  unlabel_samp = c('unlabelled', 'labelled')
)
```
This definition allows us to calculate mean read number in the 
`label_samp` pull-out fraction as a [linear combination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_combination) of the 
formulas for the labelled and unlabelled RNA amounts.

### Conditions 

Here we specify the condition `data.frame`, which includes information on 
the type of sample and the time points.

```{r}

conditions <- data.frame(
  condition = rep(names(formulaIndexes), each = nTime),
  time = rep(1:nTime, length(formulaIndexes) * nReplicates))
rownames(conditions) <- paste0("sample_", seq_along(conditions$condition))
knitr::kable(conditions)
```

### Normalisation factors

Since we are going to simulate an experiments without spike-ins, 
we  need to define the relations between different samples via
*normalisation factors*.
We divide samples into groups depending on their time point and fraction.
Except the total fraction, other samples are considered to belong to different
group if the time points are different:
```{r}
fractions <- as.character(interaction(conditions))
fractions[grep("total", fractions)] <- "total_samp"
knitr::kable(cbind(rownames(conditions),fractions))
```

Here we use the inner function  `pulseR:::addKnownToFormulas` in order 
to get the correct form of the list with the normalisation factors.
The pull-out samples include $0.3/3\cdot 100\% = 10\%$ of the unlabelled fraction.
```{r}
known <- pulseR:::addKnownToFormulas(formulas, formulaIndexes, conditions)
normFactors <- known$formulaIndexes[unique(names(known$formulaIndexes))]
normFactors <- normFactors[-grep("total", names(normFactors))]
normFactors <- c(list(total_samp = 1), normFactors)
#normFactors <- relist(seq_along(unlist(normFactors)), normFactors)
normFactors <- relist(c(1, rep(3,length(unlist(normFactors))-1)), normFactors)
normFactors[-1] <- lapply(normFactors[-1], '[[<-',2,.10)
normFactors
```

### Simulate parameters
We sample the mean expression level and the degradation rates from 
finite intervals:
```{r}
par <- list(size = 1e2)
par$mu <- runif(nGenes, 1, 1e5)
par$d <- exp(runif(nGenes,log(0.01), log(2)))


```
And, finally, we simulate the data from the negative binomial distribution
using the internal function which is also used in tests to the package:
```{r}
allNormFactors <- pulseR:::multiplyList(normFactors, fractions)

counts <- generateTestDataFrom(
  formulas, formulaIndexes, allNormFactors, par, conditions)
```

## Fitting

### Create the PulseData object
We define a PulseData object on the basis of the generated counts, the condition
matrix, relations between formulas and samples. We also provide the information
on how to split the samples for normalisation.
```{r}
pd <- PulseData(
  counts = counts,
  conditions = conditions,
  formulas = formulas,
  formulaIndexes = formulaIndexes,
  groups = fractions
)
```

### Set fitting options
In order to use the fitting function, one need to provide
the boundaries of the parameters. In addition,
we set here the relative tolerance thresholds.
```{r }
opts <- list()
lbNorms <- list(
  total_samp = 1,
  label_samp = c(.1,.010),
  unlabel_samp = c(.1,.010))
ubNorms <- list(
  total_samp = 1,
  label_samp = c(10, 2),
  unlabel_samp = c(10, 2))
opts <- setBoundaries(
  list(
  mu=c(1,1e6),
  d = range(par$d) * c(1/5, 5)),
  normFactors=list(lbNorms, ubNorms),
  options = opts
)

opts <- setTolerance(.01, normFactors = .001, options = opts)

```
### Fit
Before the fitting, one need to initialise the first guess for 
the parameters. The outcome of the fitting procedure may depend
on this initial values a lot.
```{r}
initPars <- initParameters(NULL, c("mu", "d"), pd, opts)
```
Now we are ready to start the fitting:
```{r cache=T}
res <- fitModel(pd, initPars, opts)
```

## Results
Due to 
```{r}
res$normFactors
```


```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=4}

pr <- predictExpression(pd, res)

plot(x = as.vector(pr$predictions), y = as.vector(pd$counts), 
     pch = 16, cex = .3, log = 'xy', 
     xlab = "fitted", ylab = "experiment")
```
```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=4}

plot(x = par$mu, y = res$mu, 
     pch = 16, cex = .3, log = 'xy', 
     xlab = "true", ylab = "fitted", main = "mu")
abline(0,1, col=2)
```

```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=4}
plot(x = par$d, y = res$d, 
     pch = 16, cex = .3, log = 'xy', xlab = "true", ylab = "fitted", main = "d")
abline(0,1, col=2)
```
```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=4}
plot(x = exp(-par$d), y = exp(-res$d), 
     pch = 16, cex = .3, log = 'xy',
     xlab = "true", ylab = "fitted", main = "d")
abline(0, 1, col = 2)
```

```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=4}

plot(x = par$mu, y = (res$d / par$d), 
     pch = 16, cex = .3, log = 'x',
     xlab = "true mu", ylab = "fitted/true", main = "d")
```
