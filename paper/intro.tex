Gene expression level is defined by the rates of RNA synthesis and degradation.
Understanding the way how certain gene level is regulated in a response to
the condition change might help to uncover the underlying mechanisms.

The pulse-chase experimental approach allows to study such kinetics. 
 In this method, tracing molecules are introduced to the medium, 
 which results in their incorporation into nascent RNA molecules.
4sU labelling developed by \citep{dolken2008high} used to estimate 
kinetic rates of RNA metabolism in a number of studies up to date, 
see \citep{wachutka2016measures} for review.
This experiments generate  RNA-seq data which have discrete nature.
However, there is no software for  parameter
estimation in kinetic models of gene expression, which can handle 
count data. Here we present the \verb|pulseR| package, which allows to 
process RNA-seq data from 4sU-labelling experiments.
