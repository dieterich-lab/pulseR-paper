Gene expression level is defined by the rates of RNA synthesis and degradation.
Understanding how certain gene levels are regulated in a response to
 condition changes might help to uncover the underlying control mechanisms.

The pulse-chase experimental approach allows to measure such kinetics. 
 In this method, tracing molecules are introduced to the medium, 
 which results in their incorporation into nascent RNA molecules.
4sU labelling, developed by \citep{dolken2008high}, is used to estimate 
kinetic rates of RNA metabolism in a number of studies up to date, 
see \citep{wachutka2016measures} for the review.
The  RNA-seq data generated in such experiments  have a discrete nature.
However, there is no software available for  parameter
estimation in kinetic models of gene expression, which is specifically designed to handle 
count data. Here we present the \verb|pulseR| package, which allows to 
process RNA-seq data from 4sU-labelling experiments.
