Gene expression is a dynamic process. Experiments which aim to measure
kinetics of expression levels in time can help to reveal mechanisms of gene regulation. 
With  new experimental set-ups, new types of generated data occur and one needs
to develop new methods and frameworks to be able to extract the knowledge out of 
the results.

Pulse-chase experimental approach allow to track changes 
of mRNA due to synthesis of nascent RNA molecules and
degradation of the old ones. The idea of the method is to introduce a label, which 
incorporates in the newly synthesised RNA molecules and can be traced later.
4sU labelling introduced by \citep{dolken2008high} allowed to estimate 
kinetic rates of RNA metabolism in a number of studies up to date
