Gene expression level is defined by the rates of RNA synthesis and degradation.
Understanding the way how certain gene level is regulated in a response to
the condition change might help to uncover the underlying mechanisms.

The pulse-chase experimental approach allows to study such kinetics. 
 In this method, a tracing molecules are introduced to the medium, 
 whic	h results in their incorporation into nascent RNA molecules.
4sU labelling developed by \citep{dolken2008high} allowed to estimate 
kinetic rates of RNA metabolism in a number of studies up to date
