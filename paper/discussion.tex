\subsection{Comparison to existing approaches}
The published approaches are different in terms of 
data normalisation, statistical model and underlying mathematical model of the 
RNA metabolism. Here we analyse the following software:
DRiLL \citep{rabani2014high},
INSPEcT \citep{de2015inspect},
DTA \citep{schwalb2012measurement},
HALO \citep{friedel2010halo}.
\subsubsection*{Normalisation}
Samples are mostly normalised utilising overdetermination of the system.
The normalisation coefficients are estimated via regression
(DTA, HALO?) or during the fitting together 
with other parameters (INSPEcT, DRiLL). 
Besides normalisation coupled with the parameter fitting, 
the pulseR allows to use spike-ins counts as an alternative.

\subsubsection*{Statistical model}

Since such models were first applied to microarray pulse-experiments,
the normal distribution assumptions was used (DTA, HALO).
INSPEcT and DRiLL, although being developed for the RNA-seq data,
use optimisation of residual sum of squares for the fitting, which 
implies the normality of the data. In DRiLL, expression levels are fitted
to the binomial distribution, though.
In contrast, the pulseR implements the negative binomial distribution,
which allow to work directly on the count data.

\subsection{Application}
We evaluated \verb|pulseR| performance using simulated data. 
The software is able to reproduce gene-specific parameters and 
sample normalisation factors.
