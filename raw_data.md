        compatible with any TU number in the paper. No possibility to
        join this tables.

    - normalised counts in suppl., maybe it's possible to recover the raw
        and the spike-ins

    - proprietary  
    - binomial model for mean count estimation
    - include processing in the model
    - LR test to choose between constant vs. changing rates
    - contamination with unlabelled estimated: 30.2%!
    - strange, that normalisation of laballed fraction is the same for 
        different time points
